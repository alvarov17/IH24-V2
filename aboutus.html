    <h1>About Us!</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to MyZotMeal! Here, we discuss the latest (and old) food served at UCI's two lovely dining halls, Anteatery and Brandywine!
        Through this website, you can find both reviews and photos of the daily meals provided so you won't be fooled by those pretty pictures.
